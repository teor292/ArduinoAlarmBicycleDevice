# ArduinoAlarmBicycleDevice
Arduino bicycle alarm/gps device project.

Based on Arduino NANO/Seeeduino XIAO (for GPS), SIM800L module, SW-420 and if neccessary NEO-M8N GNSS module.

If you assemble the device from this components and use the code in the repository, you can get SMS/call (and/or GPS) alarms device on your bike or anywhere.
